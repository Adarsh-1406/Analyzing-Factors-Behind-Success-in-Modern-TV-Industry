# About: 
The BA775 project was a pivotal part of our course, guided by our professor Mohammad Sultanieh-ha. Its presentation, attended by our professor and classmates, fascinated me with its deep SQL analysis of the IMDb dataset, revealing valuable insights. Using Tableau, we vividly visualized our findings, enhancing my SQL, Tableau, and analytical skills.
